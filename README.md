## Overview

This project demonstrates enterprise-grade infrastructure automation using **Ansible**
to manage and secure **100+ AWS EC2 instances**.

Key highlights:

- Dynamic AWS EC2 Inventory
- Role-based architecture
- SSH hardening
- Security baseline enforcement
- Parallel execution for scalability
- Production-ready configuration structure

---

## Architecture

Ansible Control Node securely connects to multiple EC2 instances using SSH (key-based authentication) 
and applies configuration consistently across all environments.

---

## Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|----------|
| Ansible | Configuration Management |
| AWS EC2 | Scalable Cloud Infrastructure |
| amazon.aws Collection | Dynamic Inventory |
| Linux | Target OS |
| SSH | Secure Access |

## Core Features

### Dynamic AWS Inventory

Automatically discovers running EC2 instances using:
```
plugin: amazon.aws.aws_ec2  
regions:  
  - us-east-1  
filters:  
  instance-state-name: running  
```
---

### SSH Hardening

- Root login disabled  
- Password authentication disabled  
- Enforced key-based authentication  

---

### Parallel Execution

Configured in ansible.cfg:
```
[defaults]  
forks = 50  
host_key_checking = False  
```
---

## How to Run

###  Install Dependencies
```
pip install boto3 botocore  
ansible-galaxy collection install amazon.aws  
```
---

###  Configure AWS Credentials
```
aws configure  
```
Or attach IAM role (recommended in production).

---

###  Configure SSH Key
```
mv mykey.pem ~/.ssh/  
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/mykey.pem  
```
Update ansible.cfg:
```
private_key_file = ~/.ssh/mykey.pem  
```
---

###  Validate Inventory
```
ansible-inventory -i inventory/aws_ec2.yml --graph  
```
---

###  Execute Playbook
```
ansible-playbook site.yml  
```
---

## Security Best Practices

- Key-based SSH authentication only  
- No hardcoded credentials  
- IAM role-based access recommended  
- Role-based configuration management
